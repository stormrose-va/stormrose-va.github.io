An active game world account is\n            required to use any of our services. Members whose account has been closed, or whose membership has been\n            suspended or banned by the FSEconomy staff are not eligible to use any of our services.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Any leasing contract is between Stormrose (<em>infra lessor</em>) and an FSEconomy member\n            (<em>infra lessee</em>). FSEconomy groups cannot be lessees. However, the lessee can decide about leasing\n            an aircraft to a group instead of their personal account.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Leasing contracts are not transferable.

The leasing\n            contract does not constitute any transfer of property during or at the end of the leasing contract term\n            (no &ldquo;lease to own&rdquo;). The leased aircraft remains the property of\n            <span class=\"has-text-weight-semibold\">Stormrose</span> for the whole duration of the contract. The lessee\n            may fly the aircraft, allow other FSEconomy members to fly it (group sharing or paid rental), and use it in\n            any way as permitted by FSEconomy. The lessee may not lease the aircraft to a third party (sub-leasing), or\n            sell the aircraft.\n          </p>\n          <h6 class=\"mt-5\">Leasing Fee</h6>\n          <p>\n            The leasing fee is due at the beginning of a leasing contract. The contract will remain pending until the\n            corresponding leasing fee has been paid to <span class=\"has-text-weight-semibold\">Stormrose</span> using\n            FSEconomy's banking system.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Leasing fees are non-refundable in case of a premature end of the lease term (e. g. lessee returning the\n            aircraft before end of the lease term).\n          </p>\n          <h6 class=\"mt-5\">Lease Term</h6>\n          <p>\n            Aircraft leases are good for one month. A month is defined as a period of minimum 30 calendar days, maximum\n            31 calendar days. The lease term ends at the end of the indicated contract end date (UTC time).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The lessee may extend their contract by another lease term by issuing another lease fee payment prior to the\n            end of the current lease term.\n          </p>\n          <h6 class=\"mt-5\">Fees &amp; Maintenance Cost</h6>\n          <p>\n            Monthly ownership fees are paid for by the lessor.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Random maintenance and 100 hours inspection are paid for by the lessee, engine replacement is paid for by\n            the lessor.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Cost for the first 100 hours inspection will be prorated based on a full 100 hours term if the aircraft has\n            more than 10 hours since last 100 hours inspection prior to lease. Please contact the Stormrose staff and\n            ask for a refund in such a case.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The automatic system in its current state is not able to guarantee an aircraft is free of random damage.\n            Should you have received an aircraft in need for random repair, please conduct the repair on site and ask\n            for a refund. Any random damage occurred after begin of the lease will remain in the lessee&apos;s\n            responsibility.\n          </p>\n          <h6 class=\"mt-5\">Account Closure</h6>\n          <p>\n            <span class=\"has-text-weight-semibold\">Stormrose</span> reserves the right to deny service to a member\n            of FSEconomy if they have been subject to prior disciplining through the FSEconomy Board of Directors, or\n            were otherwise caught at illicit action.
