An active game world account is required to use any of our services. Members whose account has been closed, or whose membership has been suspended or banned by the FSEconomy staff are not eligible to use any of our services. </p><p> Any leasing contract is between Stormrose (<em>infra lessor</em>) and an FSEconomy member (<em>infra lessee</em>). FSEconomy groups cannot be lessees. However, the lessee can decide about leasing an aircraft to a group instead of their personal account. </p><p> Leasing contracts are not transferable. The contract remains between the parties who initially concluded the contract. </p><h6 class="mt-5">Leased Item</h6><p> Subject to any leasing contract is the temporary use of a specific aircraft in FSEconomy. The leasing contract does not constitute any transfer of property during or at the end of the leasing contract term (no “lease to own”). The leased aircraft remains the property of <span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Stormrose</span> for the whole duration of the contract. The lessee may fly the aircraft, allow other FSEconomy members to fly it (group sharing or paid rental), and use it in any way as permitted by FSEconomy. The lessee may not lease the aircraft to a third party (sub-leasing), or sell the aircraft. </p><h6 class="mt-5">Leasing Fee</h6><p> The leasing fee is due at the beginning of a leasing contract. The contract will remain pending until the corresponding leasing fee has been paid to <span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Stormrose</span> using FSEconomy&#39;s banking system. </p><p> Leasing fees are non-refundable in case of a premature end of the lease term (e. g. lessee returning the aircraft before end of the lease term). </p><h6 class="mt-5">Lease Term</h6><p> Aircraft leases are good for one month. A month is defined as a period of minimum 30 calendar days, maximum 31 calendar days. The lease term ends at the end of the indicated contract end date (UTC time). </p><p> The lessee may extend their contract by another lease term by issuing another lease fee payment prior to the end of the current lease term. </p><h6 class="mt-5">Fees &amp; Maintenance Cost</h6><p> Monthly ownership fees are paid for by the lessor. </p><p> Random maintenance and 100 hours inspection are paid for by the lessee, engine replacement is paid for by the lessor. </p><p> Cost for the first 100 hours inspection will be prorated based on a full 100 hours term if the aircraft has more than 10 hours since last 100 hours inspection prior to lease. Please contact the Stormrose staff and ask for a refund in such a case. </p><p> The automatic system in its current state is not able to guarantee an aircraft is free of random damage. Should you have received an aircraft in need for random repair, please conduct the repair on site and ask for a refund. Any random damage occurred after begin of the lease will remain in the lessee&#39;s responsibility. </p><h6 class="mt-5">Account Closure</h6><p><span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Stormrose</span> reserves the right to deny service to a member of FSEconomy if they have been subject to prior disciplining through the FSEconomy Board of Directors, or were otherwise caught at illicit action. This also includes action not sanctioned by the FSEconomy Board of Directors, such as being involved or having been involved in scam or fraud schemes against fellow players. </p><p><span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Stormrose</span> reserves the right to temporarily suspend or permanently close an account if its owner has been found to violate the Stormrose or FSEconomy terms of service. </p></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header"><p class="card-header-title"> Special Conditions </p></div><div class="card-content content"><p> Special conditions may be granted for lease to own, long term or bulk contracts at the discretion of the <span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Stormrose</span> management.
